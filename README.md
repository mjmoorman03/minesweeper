# Minesweeper

## About The Project

I'm a huge fan of minesweeper, and I wanted to create my own version of the game. It's a fun coding challenge that allows for nice recursive algorithms, GUI design, and so much more, and all while creating a game that I love to play! If you're not familiar with minesweeper, I recommend reading a bit about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) before proceeding. \

Created using Tkinter in Python.\

Requires Python 3.7 and TKinter.\

In a terminal, run ./minesweeper.sh to begin.

## About The Game
No guess mode still in progress.\

Played like normal minesweeper, i.e. left clicks to open squares, right/middle to place flags, chording allowed.\

Win upon placing all flags in correct locations (does not check for correct locations, but you're playing against yourself, so why cheat?)\

Space bar to reset game with a new board.\
