# Minesweeper
Created using Tkinter in Python

Requires Python 3.7

## About The Game
No guess mode still in progress.

Played like normal minesweeper, i.e. left clicks to open squares, right/middle to place flags, chording allowed.

Win upon placing all flags in correct locations (does not check for correct locations, but you're playing against yourself, so why cheat?)

Space bar to reset game with new board.
